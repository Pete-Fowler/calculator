Make a working simple calculator
    Put up the calculator layout
    
    when a number is clicked
        the numbers go on the screen in a string
    
    when an operand is clicked
        the screen number is stored, another number is input, then
            if an operand is clicked again (1 + 1 +) then the previous operand
                and two numbers are computed and stored and the result
                displayed. This can continue
            if an equals sign is clicked then the values are computed, with the
                first value possibly being the stored result of several 
                computations
    when a clear button is clicked
        the display and all stored variables are cleared.
